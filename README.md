Devcontainers provide preconfigured development environments so you can start coding right away without extra setup. This repository is an example of a lightweight devcontainer setup that boots with systemd as PID 1 — ideal for running or testing services that require a real init system.

## Requirements & Installation

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
