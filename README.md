Test. 

If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-java) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.


Devcontainers provide preconfigured development environments so you can start coding right away without extra setup. This repository is an example of a lightweight devcontainer setup that boots with systemd as PID 1 — ideal for running or testing services that require a real init system.

## Requirements & Installation

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)  
Download here

### Dev Containers Extension  
In VS Code, open the Extensions view, search for "Dev Containers", and click Install.

## Usage

You can access commands two ways:

- Press F1 (or Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) to open the Command Palette  
- Or type `>` in the command bar, then type Dev Containers to see available commands in the search bar
